Assembler and VM Translator have been developed for a small 16-bit computer.Assembly language of this system mainly consists three category of instructions A-type(address),C-type(compute), L-type(label).Assembler developed converts theese assembly language instruction into a 16-bit machine code. The VM abstraction which this computer uses has five memory segments and one stack memory segment(for performing computations). VM translator developed coverts the VM language instructions into assembly language instructions.
